# Raytracing-Fast
This is an assignment on Computer Graphic Class. 
The code is based on Dirt basecode of Dartmouth Visual Computing Lab.
Based on the dirt-base code.
I wrote the shader and raytracing part.
Here I implemented a ray-triangle intersection routine and based on that implemented a ray-mesh intersection routine.
For the BBH employs axis aligned bounding box, I implemented ray-AABB intersection here.
I implemented a bounding box hierarchy in a top bottom up fashion to accekerate ray traversal speed. 
For split, I used Middle split as well as Surface Area Heuristic method.
